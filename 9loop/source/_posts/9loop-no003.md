### are you happy with where you are in life rn

> **Dean**: Probably
> 
> **tango **: i’ll be happy when im tekken king
> 
> **ethan 🤫🧏**: Goodness and happiness are ideals that we reach for but can never achieve, and we are only deluding ourselves if we try to think that we can, indeed, ever reach them. Only the intellectually inferior would hold these as ideals, as it is illegical to hold an ideal which is not only inconceivable, but simply a waste of time. As nobody will ever truly achieve goodness and happiness, it is wasteful to strive for it. It i similar to the tune of religion - having faith in something which cannot be proven is illegical and a waste of time because there is no reasonable endpoint to achieve. I don't expect that the inferior minds of Reddit will comprehend this, but I am expressing it in the hopes that all of you will gain something from the nowledge that I impart upon to you. Trust me, I have achieved a course grade of B+ in my philosophy class (one of the highest that has ever been given out by my professor, a PhD), and he has imparted upon me the distinction of being among his brighter students (although I'm sure he only said that in the name of modesty, as I know I am his favorite by far).
